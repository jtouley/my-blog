In previous posts, I’ve shared the mindsets that shape my approach to data leadership—from challenging legacy norms in [*Who Moved My Cheese Shaped My Approach to Data Leadership*](https://medium.com/@jtouley/how-who-moved-my-cheese-shaped-my-approach-to-data-leadership-b692af9ec175) to driving sustainable technical strategies in [*The Power of the Done Once, Done Right Mindset in Data*](https://medium.com/@jtouley/building-future-ready-data-architectures-the-power-of-the-done-once-done-right-mindset-in-data-407bf6799c9b).

But leadership isn’t just about what you believe—it’s about how you operate. This document is my attempt to codify that. It’s the way I hold myself accountable and the expectations I set for others who carry the title of “leader.”

# The Operating Manual: Leading with Standards, Not Ego

_I’m not here to be liked.  
I’m here to do my job—and I expect others to do the same._

This document lays out how I lead, how I communicate, and what I expect from others who hold the title of “leader.” If you're working with me, here's what you should know:

---

## 01. I Lead with Clarity

I don't traffic in vague priorities, feel-good half-answers, or strategies built on sand.  
If I ask hard questions, it’s not to embarrass you—it’s to uncover risk, prevent swirl, and protect the work.  
I don’t believe in setting traps. I believe in shining light on assumptions.

---

## 02. Feedback Is a Gift—And a Requirement

If I challenge your plan, it’s because I expect better—and believe you’re capable of delivering it.  
I’m not here to coddle. I’m here to grow leaders.

That means:
- If your logic doesn’t hold up, I’ll say so.  
- If you’re avoiding responsibility, I’ll call it out.  
- If your plan is solid, I’ll get out of your way and back you fully.

---

## 03. I Don’t Confuse Autonomy With Avoidance

If you ask for more room to lead, show me you’re ready by:
- Taking ownership of the full problem—not just a slice of it.  
- Being transparent about what you don’t know.  
- Asking for feedback before failure, not after.

If you want space, earn it. I’ll gladly step back—when you step up.

---

## 04. Bring the TL;DR

Long-winded documentation that doesn’t distill the problem is a red flag.  
I value clear, thoughtful summaries that show you’ve done the thinking.  
If you can’t explain your logic in 1–3 sentences, it’s likely not sound yet.  
Communicate to convey, not to justify.

---

## 05. I Don’t Expect Perfection—Just Ownership

You can be wrong. You can stumble.  
What you can’t do is hide. Own your mistakes. Own your gaps. Own the outcomes.  
I’ll never penalize someone for being wrong.  
But I will challenge anyone who refuses to take responsibility.

---

## 06. I Will Always Default to Action

If you don’t bring a clear plan or a willingness to adjust, I will move forward without you.  
This isn’t impatience—it’s protection of momentum.  
I’ll never steamroll ideas, but I also won’t let indecision or vague strategy hold the team hostage.

---

## 07. You Don’t Have to Like My Style—Just Be Better Than It

If you don’t like how direct I am, that’s fine. Beat me with better thinking.  
Show me a clearer path. Deliver results that speak for themselves.  
I don’t care about being right—I care about getting it right.  
If you can outthink me, please do.

---

## 08. Leadership Is Earned Daily

Titles don’t protect you from accountability.  
If I know the stack better than you, and I’m thinking further ahead than you, that’s not dominance—it’s a wake-up call.  
Step into the responsibility, or step aside.  
The team deserves leadership that thinks, acts, and owns at a higher level.

---

## Final Word

This isn’t about tone. This is about trust.  
This isn’t about control. This is about care.  
This isn’t about ego. This is about standards.

I will never apologize for holding the line.  
If you're ready to meet that line—or rise above it—we’re going to do incredible things together.
